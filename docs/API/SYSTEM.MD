# `validate/address`

Validates a register / legacy address .


### Endpoint:

`/system/validate/address`


### Parameters:

`address` : The base58 encoded register or legacy address to check.


### Return value JSON object:

```

### Return values:

`address` : The address that was validated.

`type` : For register addresses, the type of register at the address.  Values can be `APPEND`, `LEGACY`, `OBJECT`, `RAW`, `READONLY`, `RESERVED`, `SYSTEM`, or `UNKNOWN`.

`object_type` : If the `type` is `OBJECT` this field contains the standard object type of the object register.  Values can be `ACCOUNT`, `CRYPTO`, `NAME`, `NAMESPACE`, `REGISTER`, `TOKEN`, `TRUST`, or `UNKNOWN`.

`is_mine` : If the `type` is `LEGACY` this boolean flag indicates if the private key for the address is held in the local wallet.
