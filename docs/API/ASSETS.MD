# Assets API
-----------------------------------

An asset is a user-defined data structure that is stored in an object register, owned by a particular signature chain. Assets can hold one or more pieces of data and users can define the fields (name, data type, mutability) that data is stored in. The assets API supports several formats for defining the object data structures giving users and developers varying levels of functionality, including per-field type definition and mutability.  

The `basic` format allows callers to define an asset in terms of simple key-value pairs. It assumes that all fields are read-only and all values are stored using the string data type. `basic ` assets are always immutable and cannot be updated once created.

The `JSON`, `ANSI`, and `XML` formats allow callers to provide a detailed definition of the asset data structure, with each field defined with a specific data type and mutability. Assets defined with one of the complex formats can be updated after their initial creation.  

The `raw` format differs from the other formats in that the asset data is not stored in object register, but instead is stored in a read-only state register. The raw format is useful when developers wish to store arbitrary binary data on the Nexus blockchain, without incurring the overhead of defining an object.

***


# `create/asset`

This will create a new asset or object register. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the new asset name in the URI.  For example `/assets/create/myasset` will resolve to `assets/create/asset?name=myasset`.   


### Endpoint:

`/assets/create/asset`


### Parameters:

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) the asset should be created with. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : A name to identify the asset. A hash of the name will determine the register address. If no name is provided, a random 256-bit register hash will be generated.

`format` : The format the caller is using to define the asset. Values can be `basic` (the default), `raw`, `JSON`, `ANSI` (not currently supported), or `XML` (not currently supported). This is an optional field and the value `basic` is assumed if omitted.

`data` : If format is `raw`, then this field contains the hex-encoded data to be stored in this asset. Raw assets are always read-only. All other preceding fields are ignored.

`<fieldname>=<value>` : If format is `basic`, then the caller can provide additional <fieldname>=<value> pairs for each piece of data to store in the asset.

`json` : If format is `JSON`, then this field will hold the json definition of the asset as a JSON array of objects representing each field in the object. It uses the following format:

- `name` : The name of the data field.
- `type` : The data type to use for this field. Values can be `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `uint256`, `uint512`, `uint1024`, `string`, or `bytes`.
- `value` : The default value of the field.
- `mutable` : The boolean field to indicate whether the field is writable (true) or read-only (false).


`token_name` : The name of a token to use to tokenize the asset. If provided, this will immediately tokenize the asset into fungible tokens that represent ownership of the asset.
`token_address` : The register address of a token to use to tokenize the asset. If provided, this will immediately tokenize the asset into fungible tokens that represent ownership of the asset.  `token_name` can be supplied as an alternative to `token_address`.


### Example:

The following is an example of an asset defined using the `basic` format:   
**NOTE**: In this example the asset is entirely read-only and no fields can be updated.
```
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "16953804956473956578",
    "name": "watch",
    "format": "basic",
    "serial_number": "123456789123456789",
    "description": "This is the description of my asset",
    "shelf_location": "Aisle 9 Shelf 2"
}
```

The following is an example of an asset defined using the `JSON` format:   
**NOTE**: In this example the shelf_location field is defined as mutable and can therefore be updated.
```
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "16953804956473956578",
    "name": "watch",
    "format": "JSON",
    "json" :
        [
            {
                "name": "serial_number",
                "type": "uint64",
                "value": "123456789123456789",
                "mutable" : "false"
            },
            {
                "name": "description",
                "type": "string",
                "value": "This is the description of my asset",
                "mutable" : "false"
            },
            {
                "name": "shelf_location",
                "type": "string",
                "value": "Aisle 9 Shelf 2",
                "mutable" : "true"
            }
        ]
}
```




### Return value JSON object:
```
{
    "txid": "27ef3f31499b6f55482088ba38b7ec7cb02bd4383645d3fd43745ef7fa3db3d1"

```

### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the asset creation.
