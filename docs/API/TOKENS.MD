Tokens API
-----------------------------------

The Tokens API provides methods for creating fungible tokens, creating accounts to store them in, and sending and receiving tokens between users. 


## `Named Shortcuts`

For each API method we support an alternative endpoint that includes the token/account name or register address at the end of the URI.  This shortcut removes the need to include the name name or address as an additional parameter.  

For example `tokens/create/account/savings` is a shortcut to `tokens/create/account?name=savings`.

Similarly `tokens/get/token/5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9` is a shortcut to `tokens/get/token?address=5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9`  

The logic for resolving the shortcut to either a name or address is that if the data is 64 characters of hexadecimal then it will be assumed to be a register address.  Otherwise it will be considered a name.

# `create/token`

Create a new token object register. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the new token name in the URI.  For example `/tokens/create/token/mytoken` will resolve to `tokens/create/token?name=mytoken`.   


### Endpoint:

`/tokens/create/token`


### Parameters:

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) the token should be created with. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : A name to identify the token. A hash of the name will determine the register address. If no name is provided, a random 256-bit register hash will be generated.

`supply` : The initial token supply amount.

`digits` : The maximum number of decimal places that can be applied to token amounts.  For example digits=2 will allow a token amount to be given to 2 decimal places.

### Example:

```
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "16953804956473956578",
    "name": "ABC",
    "supply": 1000000,
    "digits": 4
}
```

### Return value JSON object:
```    
{
    "txid": "f9dcd28bce2563ab288fab76cf3ee5149ea938c735894ce4833b55e474e08e8a519e8005e09e2fc19623577a8839a280ca72b6430ee0bdf13b3d9f785bc7397d",
    "address": "f2f71204bda6e6512d21c48eb4ca98db37a25c4d152afb284f3fc36760c0c717"
}
```   

### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the token creation.

`address` : The register address for this token. The address (or name that hashes to this address) is needed when creating token accounts, so that we know which token the account can be used with.

***

# `debit/token`

Deduct a token amount from a token's initial supply and send it to a token account. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the token name in the URI.  For example `/tokens/debit/token/mytoken` will resolve to `tokens/debit/token?name=mytoken`.   


### Endpoint:

`/tokens/debit/token`


### Parameters:

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) the token owner. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : The name identifying the token to debit. This is optional if the address is provided.  The name should be in namespace:name format

`namespace` : The namespace that the token was created in. This is optional if the address is provided or the name is provided in the namespace:name format.

`address` : The register address of the token to debit. This is optional if the name is provided.

`amount` : The amount of tokens to debit.

`name_to` : The name identifying the token account to send to. This is optional if the address is provided.  The name should be in namespace:name format

`address_to` : The register address of the token account to send to. This is optional if the name is provided.

### Example:

The following example shows the json payload for a debit of 10.5 ABC tokens (that itself was created by the sig chain logged into session "16953804956473956578") being sent to a token account identified by the name "jack:savings".  In the name_to field, "jack" refers to the username of the account holder and "savings" is their token account.  If jack is concerned about privacy he could have provided the register address of his token account instead

```
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "16953804956473956578",
    "name": "bob:ABC",
    "amount": 10.5,
    "name_to": "jack:savings"
}
```

### Return value JSON object:
```    
{
    "txid": "f9dcd28bce2563ab288fab76cf3ee5149ea938c735894ce4833b55e474e08e8a519e8005e09e2fc19623577a8839a280ca72b6430ee0bdf13b3d9f785bc7397d"
}
```   

### Return values:

`txid` : The ID (hash) of the transaction that includes the token debit.

# `credit/token`

Increment the token balance by an amount received from a token account. This method allows fungible tokens to be recycled back to the token creator in circumstances where they have reached the end of their life-cycle, for example a loyalty token that has been used by the customer to pay for a product can be debited from the customer's account and back to the token for reuse.  The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the token name to credit in the URL.  For example `/tokens/credit/token/mytoken` will resolve to `tokens/credit/token?name=mytoken`.   


### Endpoint:

`/tokens/credit/token`


### Parameters:

`pin` : The PIN for this signature chain.

`session` : For multi-user API mode, (configured with multiuser=1) the session is required to identify which session (sig-chain) owns the token account. For single-user API mode the session should not be supplied.

`name` : The name identifying the token to credit. This is optional if the address is provided.  The name should be in namespace:name format

`namespace` : The namespace that the token was created in. This is optional if the address is provided or the name is provided in the namespace:name format.

`address` : The register address of the token to credit. This is optional if the name is provided.

`txid` : The transaction ID (hash) of the corresponding debit transaction for which you are creating this credit for.



### Example:

The following example shows the json payload for a credit to a token called "mytoken" (that itself was created by the sig chain logged into session "16953804956473956578").  

```
{
    "pin": "1234",
    "session": "16953804956473956578",
    "name": "mytoken",
    "txid": "f9dcd28bce2563ab288fab76cf3ee5149ea938c735894ce4833b55e474e08e8a519e8005e09e2fc19623577a8839a280ca72b6430ee0bdf13b3d9f785bc7397d"
}
```

### Return value JSON object:
```    
{
    "txid": "318b86d2c208618aaa13946a3b75f14472ebc0cce9e659f2830b17e854984b55606738f689d886800f21ffee68a3e5fd5a29818e88f8c5b13b9f8ae67739903d"
}
```   

### Return values:

# `get/token`

Retrieves information about a token and its supply. The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the token name in the URI.  For example `/tokens/get/token/mytoken` will resolve to `tokens/get/token?name=mytoken`.   

Additionally the API supports passing a field name in the URL after the token name, which will populate the `fieldname` parameter in the request.  For example `/tokens/get/token/mytoken/supply` will resolve to `tokens/get/token?name=mytoken&fieldname=supply`

### Endpoint:

`/tokens/get/token`


### Parameters:


`name` : The name identifying the token to retrieve. This is optional if the address is provided.  The name should be in namespace:name format

`namespace` : The namespace that the token was created in. This is optional if the address is provided or the name is provided in the namespace:name format.

`address` : The register address of the token to retrieve. This is optional if the name is provided.

`fieldname`: This optional field can be used to filter the response to return only a single field from the token.

### Return value JSON object:
```    
{
    "name": "mytoken",
    "address": "5efc8a9437d93e894defd50f8ba73a0b2b5529cc593d5e4a7ea413022a9c35e9",

`balance` : The current balance of this token.  Initially the balance of the token is equal to the max supply, until the tokens have been distributed to accounts.

`maxsupply` : The maximum token supply amount.

`currentsupply` : The current amount of tokens that have been distributed to token accounts.

`digits` : The maximum number of decimal places that can be applied to token amounts.  For example digits=2 will allow a token amount to be given to 2 decimal places.
