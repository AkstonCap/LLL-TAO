# Names API
-----------------------------------

Names and Namespaces are special kinds of object registers that are used as locators to other object registers in the blockchain.  When an object register is first created (an asset for example) the caller can provide a name for the register.  If a name is provided then a Name object register is also created with its register address based on a hash of the name.  The Name object also has a address field, which is populated with the register address of the asset that the Name "points" to.  In this way, the asset object can be retrieved by name by first hashing the name to get the Name object's address, retrieving the Name object, and then using the address stored within it to retrieve the asset object.  A Name then, is best thought of as a named index to object registers.

By default all Name objects are created within the users local namespace, meaning that when accessing an object by name it must be prefixed with the owners username, e.g. paul:someasset.  Local namespaces are denoted by the format username:objectname, allowing the same objectname to be used by more than one user.   Alternatively Nexus allows for global namespaces to be registered and then used when creating Names, allowing the asset name to be decoupled from the user owning the asset.  Names that use global namespaces are denoted by the format objectname.namespace.      

The Names API allows callers to access and manage both Names and Namespaces.  Names can be created to "point" to any register address you wish, whether the caller owns the register or not.  This is useful, for example, if somebody gives you the register address of a NXS account to receive payments and you wish to add a friendly Name for it for future use.

Namespaces can be transferred to other signature chains, opening the possibility for a secondary market to buy and sell namespaces (similar to internet domain names).

Names that have been created within a namespace can also be transferred to other signature chains.  Names created without a namespace (user local names) cannot be transferred.

# `create/name`

This will create a new name.  The API supports an alternative endpoint that can include the new name in the URL.  For example `/names/create/name/myname` will resolve to `names/create/name?name=myname`.   


### Endpoint:
