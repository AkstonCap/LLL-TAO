# Comments Guide

Comments in this library should be written as you develop new code. The practice of "code now, comment later" will leave you in a hole of procrastination that will inevitably lead to comment spurts. We would like to see comments describe functions fully, and sub comments describe blocks of code in full sentences. Comments should be included to support Doxygen building over methods and classes in header files. Inside the corresponding source files, the method description should be non-doxygen, and be a repeat of the function description from the headers. The following will give a brief example


## Header Files

```
class Test
{
public:

    /** Describe Data Members. **/
    uint32_t nDataMember;

    /** Function
     *
     *  Function Description
     *
     *  @param[in] nArg The argument for...
     *
     **/
    void Function(uint32_t nArg);
}
```

## Source Files

```
/* Function Description */
void Test::Function(uint32_t nArg)
{
    /* Brief Description of Local Variable. */
    uin32_t nSum = 0;

    /* Brief Description of Process. */
    for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        nSum += nSum;
    }
}
```
