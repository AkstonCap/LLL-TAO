This direcotry contains a Nexus app that implements a demo of an education
use-case.

Students, Teachers, and Universities can log into this web server application.
Students take tests and if they score a 70 or better on the test, they get
credit with award tokens. Teachers monitor tests and grant award tokens to
Students. Students accumulate award tokens to be used for tuition assistance
from Universities. Students spend their award tokens for scholarship tokens
issued by Unverisities.

Students, Teachers and Universities can see the scholarship offerings that
all Universities post. Students can see status of their test taking and
the award token grant status from Teachers. Teachers can monitor the test
results of each student anonymously.

Students spend award tokens in return for receiving scholarship tokens which
can be used later to convert to USD for tuition assistance.

This application uses the 'accounts' and 'tokens' API via the python SDK.

You can create accounts for each user type (Student, Teacher, University) to
get started. Test taking is simulated but can be retaken until you pass.
