# Thread sanitizer suppressions file for Nexus

# If you run with thread sanitizer enabled (compile Nexus with RACE_CHECK=1),
# and wish to avoid a bunch of warnings from Berkeley database, then
# add an environment variable defining TSAN_OPTIONS pointing to this file

# Example (added to .bashrc file)
# export TSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=tsan_suppressions"

# Ignore functions in Berkeley database libraries
