      * This class performs all operations for mining legacy blocks on the Proof of Stake channel.
      * Intialize the LegacyMinter by calling GetInstance() the first time. 
      *
      * Staking does not start, though, until StartStakeMinter() is called for the first time.
      * This retrieves a wallet reference and begins staking for the current legacy wallet.
      *
      * The trust key and balance from the wallet will be used for Proof of Stake.
      * Mined PoS blocks will add coinstake transactions to this wallet and move balance
      * to the wallet's trust key. If the wallet does not have a trust key to start, one will be
      * created from its key pool and the minter will mine for its Genesis transaction.
      *
      * Staking operations can be suspended by calling StopStakeMinter (for example, if the wallet is locked)
      * and restarted by calling StartStakeMinter() again.
